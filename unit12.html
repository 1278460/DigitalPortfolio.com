        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">

          In this unit we covered characteristics, uses of software programs, designing, developing software, developing more software and testing software.
          <br><br>

          In the first assignment covers the purpose of two simple programs, their characteristics, tools, techniques, quality of one of the given software programs,
what the improvements would be on one of the given software programs, a flowchart to show the processing of one of the given software programs and
strengths and weaknesses of one of the given software programs. My first assignment below:

        <br><br>
        In the second assignment covers the purpose and user requirements for the software program, design for a program including a problem definition
statement, a proposed solution, a list of any pre-defined functions/subroutines and a test plan, a detailed design for a program including alternative
solutions, a detailed proposed solution using a range of design tools and test data, the design decisions including the state purpose and user
requirements and any design constraints. My second assignment below:

        <br><br>
        In my third and last assignment covers the development of a software program, the understanding of the features of the Visual Basic programming
environment, understanding what the variables are, how variables are used in the development of a software program, programming principles and
practices in the development of a software program, usage of different algorithms in order to process and manipulate data, methods that can be used to
debug program code, ensuring that the quality of software is maintained, the quality of a finished software program can be checked, making sure that it is
fit for purpose, different factors that can constrain software development and how they might be overcome.
