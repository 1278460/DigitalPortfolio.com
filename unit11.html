          <h1 class="paragraph">Unit 11 â€“ Computer Networks</h1>

        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">

          For this unit we will be cover the features and uses of computer networks, what is a computer network, what are the strengths and weaknesses of computer networks, purpose
and requirement of computer and design a network. We are currently taking sessions in preparation of the first assignment out of three assignments.
          <br><br>

          For the first assignment we had to explain the uses and features of a small office network and a multi-player network where people like to play computer games simultaneously,
          choose one of the two networks to review how the uses and features of one of the networks affect the user experience, discuss a minimum of one strength and one weakness of
          the network. Plus for this assignment it had to be an illustrated document to support the work.

        <br><br>
        We had to consider how to design a computer network, what is needed to set-up to configure the components, use software to test our design ideas, consider alternatives, what
should be included within a test plan and to make sure the network design meets the user requirements. In steps to: describe the purpose and client requirements for the network,
produce a design for a computer network, list of hardware and software components, their role, how they connect and communicate with each other, a network diagram and a test
plan, produce a detailed design for a computer network including alternative solutions, an outline of how the computer network will be set up and how the computer network will be
configured, test data and costs involved with setting up the computer network.
