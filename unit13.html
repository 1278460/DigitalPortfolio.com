        <br>
        <div class="paragraph">

          This unit is about creating an optional website that we had to choose to work on. My choice was to create an Essex pet rescue website to fit the requirements of the three
assignments. Using Dreamweaver as the software used to create our websites. We have covered investigating two websites, designing our chosen company to create a website
for, prepare assets for our websites, develop our websites, add in at least one interactive feature, review our websites, gain feedback from others and make any improvements.
        <br><br>

        For the first assignment we have investigated two websites in preparation for the second assignment. The assignment to include the intended uses, features, review how the
features improve presentation, usability, accessibility, performance, the strengths and weaknesses of two websites.
