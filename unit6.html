        I have completed our third and last assignment which was to build the template and the apple butter jar labels products for the graphics design company
called Buzz. We had to prepare assets for the graphics products, demonstrating awareness of purpose, list of sources for read-made assets, testing the
products for quality, purpose, against the original requirements, making any necessary improvements, prepare high-quality assets for the graphic
products, all sources of assets fully referenced, gather feedback on quality of the products, refine assets to create two high-quality digital graphic
products, demonstrate awareness of audience and purpose, explain how the final product is suitable for the intended audience and purpose, review the
extent to which each of the final graphic products meets the needs of audience and the purpose, consider feedback from others and any constraints,
making recommendations for further improvement and evaluate the initial designs and the final graphic products and justify any changes made.
